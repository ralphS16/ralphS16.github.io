			<p> I am a postdoctoral fellow in computer science at PPLV (University College London). I recently
				successfully defended my PhD thesis in theoretical computer science at <a
					href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/">LIP</a> (ENS de Lyon), supervised by Matteo Mio and Valeria
				Vignudelli. Here are the <a href="src/TalkDefense.pdf">slides</a> and <a
					href="src/Manuscript.pdf">manuscript</a>. I also have a masters in theoretical computer science from
				ENS de Lyon and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University. My main interests
				are category theory, theory of computation and logic. I have been keeping a sparse journal of my
				professional activities <a
					href="https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/274877-community.3A-our-work/topic/Ralph.20Sarkis/near/229199955">here</a>.
				My non-academic interests include but are not limited to playing squash, vegan cooking, programming
				(Python and JavaScript mostly), watching <a href=# onclick="randomVideo();">YouTube</a>, and playing
				Spikeball.</p>

			<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>For Nonmathematicians</summary>
				<p>
					As you might have inferred from the rest of my website, I really enjoy teaching.
					Unfortunately, my day-to-day activities involve too many levels of abstraction for me to
					easily describe them to nonexperts. Thanks to years of practice, I was able to find very
					good (in my opinion) answers to the question "What do you study?" that help my family and
					friends better understand what I do. Here are the best relatively short and simple
					explanations I could come up with to describe my favorite fields of study (in no particular
					order).
				</p>

				<h3>Complexity Theory</h3>
				<p>
					This one is heavily inspired from examples in <a
						href="http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~japaridz/">Giorgi Japaridze</a>'s <a
						href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-0072(03)00023-X"><i>Introduction to Computability
							Logic</i></a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main goal of complexity theory is to answer the question "What makes a problem hard or
					easy to solve with a computer?". Of course, there are many angles to attack this question,
					for example, one needs to define what is a computer, what is a problem, and what it means
					for a problem to be hard or easy. I will save these discussions for later and only
					demonstrate the difficulty in answering this question. Let me describe three different tasks
					varying in complexity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your first task is to win at chess against the best artificial intelligence designed to
					optimally play chess. To make this easier on you, you can control the white pieces (you play
					first) and it is considered a win for you if the game resolves in a stalemate (tie). You
					probably know that this is almost impossible to do; all grandmasters of chess (the best
					human players) cannot compete even with AI players built decades ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your second task is to play two games of chess against the best AI and win (or tie) on <b>at least
						one board</b>. To make it slightly fairer, in your first game, you control the
					white pieces, and in your second game, you control the black pieces. I will let you convince
					yourself that the second task is harder than the first one because the latter is included in
					the former. Namely, to complete the second task, you must win at chess against the AI and
					hence complete the first task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your third task is to play two games of chess <b>simultaneously</b> against the best AI and
					win (or tie) on at least one board. Again, there is a board where you play whites and a
					board where you play blacks. At first sight, this task may look harder than the first one
					(because you are playing on two boards at once) and just as hard as the second one. In any
					case, this should still be hopeless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surprisingly, the third task is the easiest to complete and anyone could do it after being
					told the strategy. You simply have to copy the moves done by the AI on one board on the
					other board. That is, you let the AI play its first move on the board where it plays whites
					and you do the same move on the board where you play whites, then you wait for the AI's
					answer to that move and you replicate it on the other board. Whatever happens during the
					game, if the AI wins (or ties) on one board, you automatically win (or tie) on the other
					board, thus you complete the task.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is very fascinating to me (and I guess to most complexity theorists) how these three
					tasks with a very similar description have very different intrinsic difficulties. To
					rephrase the ultimate goal of complexity theory, it would be wonderful if we could tell how
					hard it is to solve a problem by looking only at its statement.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I have mentioned, there is a lot more to complexity theory that was not advertised in
					this toy example. Still, I hope this makes you wonder more deeply about the original
					question as many computer scientists do every day.
				</p>

				<h3>Semantics</h3>
				<p>
					My main field of research is called <b>categorical semantics</b>. I have yet to come up with
					a quick layman explanation for the term 'categorical', but I think I can give you the gist
					of what studying the semantics of programming languages means.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is infamously hard to predict the result of executing a computer program by looking at
					its code. Of course, humans (with programming experience) are exceptionally good at this
					task; if you ask a programmer to look at some simple code written by another human, they
					will surely be able to describe what it does. However, this takes time and as the code gets
					longer and more complex, humans are more likely to make mistakes. This is the main reason
					why bugs exist — ironically, the origin of the word "bug" suggests that the error is not the
					programmer's fault. The principal objective of program semantics is to help design programs
					that can understand how other programs behave by looking at their code.
				</p>
				<p>
					The term <b>semantics</b> comes from a central step in the analysis of programs where we
					give meaning to each part of the code before bringing it together into information about the
					whole program. The details vary wildly depending on the method used, how the program is
					specified (e.g. what programming language), and the properties of the program that are
					considered. Anyway, you can basically think of this step as a translation of the code into
					abstract mathematical objects which themselves have to be interpreted to understand the
					result.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me use a cooking analogy to give more intuition about the process described above. It is
					also hard to predict the result of a recipe without following its every step. This time,
					even a human (with cooking experience) will have a hard time being able to tell with good
					accuracy what the end result is supposed to look like, if it will taste good to them, etc. —
					I concede that a very good chef who has seen similar recipes before will fare better, but if
					they have never seen how, say, puff pastry is made, I doubt they can foresee the
					transformation from layers of dough and butter into flaky, crusty and light pastries.
				</p>
				<p>
					One could imagine a program that reads a recipe and generates the outcome of each step as a
					sequence of chemical reactions (these replace the abstract mathematical objects in the
					programming story) that will happen during the cooking. The program could then extract some
					useful information to tell us whether there is too much compounds that taste like burnt
					food, there is not enough chocolate flavor compounds, the Maillard reaction has produced
					enough brown color, enough water evaporated to get a crispy crust, and so on...
				</p>
				<p>
					It is hard to say with certainty which of analyzing code or recipes is easiest (see my
					explanation of complexity theory), but I would certainly love it if we are able to do either
					in my lifetime.
				</p>
				<!-- Paragraph on formal verification? This helps in the field of formal verification (to name one application) where we often want to know whether a program fits a given specification. As an example, let us consider software that is run on a self-checkout machine in a supermarket, here are some questions we would like to answer to ensure it works well:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Is there a possibility to enter an undesired infinite loop? The execution of this software can be seen as a loop that handles one customer, resets after they payed and welcomes the next customer until . If the machine gets into another infinite loop, the checkout process could not be completed and a </li>
							<li>Is there always the possibility to reset the checkout process? (This avoid the necessity of restarting the machine when </li>
							<li>Does it compute the right taxes regardless of what was scanned?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>-->

				<summary>Hodgepodge of Ideas</summary>
				<p>
					Here are hand-picked ideas (they maximize some function depending on originality and
					potential) from my much longer list of ideas.

				<h3>Crowdsourcing YouTube Captions in Class</h3>
				<p>
					I would like to build a platform where language teachers can give as homework to their
					students the task of captioning YouTube videos. Initially, the teacher can assemble a big
					playlist with videos in their desired language which have no captioning yet (or maybe the
					video has caption in one language but not in another). Then they can ask their students to
					choose a video in this playlist and caption it (or translate the existing captions).
					Finally, the teacher can go over the work done by the students and correct it before
					submitting the captions to YouTube.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think that many people (teachers, creators, and students) could benefit from a platform
					like this. I trust the great diversity in the content published to YouTube will make it
					possible for every teacher to find videos they think are suitable for their class and for
					every student to find a video they can engage with. The creators will also reach a larger
					audience through this platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also pretty sure this could easily be implemented as part of Google Classroom. As of
					November 2020, I have not found such a project and even worse, YouTube has recently removed
					the community contributions.
				</p>
				<h3>Restaurants Sharing Recipe Videos</h3>
				<p>
					I always wonder how the food I order at restaurants is made, and I am sure I am not alone.
					While scrolling through social media, I often come across videos of people making beautiful
					food, and it makes me hungry. Sharing the process of cooking a dish in a video or gif format
					could be an excellent way for restaurants to attract more customers. Many people choose
					restaurants by looking at online menus, and having videos of the dishes being made would
					provide an added level of appeal.
				</p>
				<p>
					To make this possible, restaurants could hire video producers to create videos of their
					dishes being made. These videos could be shared on the restaurant's menu or on already
					existing platforms such as social media, reviews agregators (e.g. Google Maps), making it
					easier for customers to discover and choose a restaurant. While producing these videos may
					require some investment, it could be a worthwhile way for restaurants to stand out and
					attract more customers. Additionally, it could provide an opportunity for aspiring video
					producers to work with restaurants and showcase their skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that creating a good website for a restaurant can be challenging, especially if
					they need to incorporate videos. That is where my second idea comes in: creating a template
					for a restaurant website that includes the option to display videos of their dishes being
					made. I don't know how to best display menu items and the videos of them being made to get a
					seamless way for customers (especially on mobile), I am sure a UI/UX designer will find this
					a fascinating challenge.
