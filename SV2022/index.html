        <h1>Semantics and Verification - Winter 2022</h1>
		I will hold weekly office hours (schedule TBD) in addition to the TDs. During those, you can come to my office (M7.314, 3rd floor, south wing, Monod) and ask anything you would like about the course. You can also send me an email to schedule an appointment/call if the office hours do not fit your schedule.
