<h1>Chapter 1: #1.23</h1>
<p>($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $B = B^+$, then for any $w,y \in B$, $wy \in B$, hence $BB \subseteq B$.
</p>
<p>($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $BB \subseteq B$, since any word in $BB$ is in $B$, we also have $BBB \subseteq B$ and so on, for 
any number of times, yielding $B^+ \subseteq B$. Since clearly $B \subseteq B^+$, we have the equality.
