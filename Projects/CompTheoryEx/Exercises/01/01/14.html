<h1>Chapter 1: #1.14</h1>
<p><ol type="a">
<li>Let $M = (Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a deterministic finite automaton that recognizes the language $B$. 
More formally, swapping the accepting states means constructing a new DFA $M' = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, Q \setminus F)$, 
we need to show that $M'$ recognizes $B^c$. Let $w$ be a string in $B^c$, since the transition function of $M$ and $M'$
are the same, the ending state of both machines after processing $w$ must be the same, call it $q^*$. Since $M$ recognizes $B$, 
$q^*$ cannot be in $F$, so it is in $Q \setminus F$. This is the set of accepting state in $M'$, so $w$ is accepted by $M'$. 
On the other hand, if $w \in B$, $q^*$ must be in $F$ so it is not in $Q \setminus F$ implying that $M'$ does not accept it. 
We can conclude that $M'$ recognizes $B^c$. Since, we started with an arbitrary DFA and an arbitrary language, we have shown 
that the regular languages are closed under complement.

It recognizes the language $\Sigma_{\varepsilon}^*$ but if we swap the accept states, the resulting NFA will also recognize $\Sigma_{\varepsilon}^*$. 
We cannot determine if the class of languages recognized by NFA's is closed under complement from this result. However, it is 
a theorem that DFA's are equivalent to NFA's, so this class is indeed closed under complement.
