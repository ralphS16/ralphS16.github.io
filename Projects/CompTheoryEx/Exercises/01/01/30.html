<h1>Chapter 1: #1.30</h1>
<p>The problem is that Example 1.73 from the textbook shows $\texttt{0}^p\texttt{1}^p$ cannot be pumped in the language 
$\texttt{0}^n\texttt{1}^n$. However, inside $\texttt{0*1*}$ it can be pumped, for example, by putting $x = \varepsilon$, 
$y = \texttt{0}$ and $z = \texttt{0}^{p-1}\texttt{1}^p$; the string $y^iz$ is in the language for any $i \in \N$.
