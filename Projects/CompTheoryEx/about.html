This is the solutions for the exercises at the end of each chapter in Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser (3rd. ed. Intl.).
I have compiled these solutions myself (unless otherwise stated) and will try to post as much as I can, I hope to do the whole book.
Unfortunately, these answer are most probably not the best ones nor the ones expected by the authors of the book.
Hence, I am not liable for any injury that were caused by the use of this set of solutions.
If you have any question or correction, contact me by email (it is on my homepage).
