				<p>&nbsp To conclude, our fractal is named Trypopopopopophobia. At every iteration, we add 5 spheres based on the three-dimensional cartesian plan and the radius of each new spheres is half the length of the previous ones. To find the volume of our fractal until an iteration <i>i</i>, we need use this formula : \(\frac{4\pi \cdot R^{3}}{3} + \sum_{n=1}^{i} \frac{24\pi \cdot 5^{n-1} \cdot R^{3}}{3\cdot2^{3n}}\)and we found out the the volume always converges to a certain value based on the radius of the initial sphere : \(\frac{4\pi \cdot R^{3}}{3} + \pi \cdot R^{3} \cdot \frac{8}{3}\). For the surface area, to find it at a specific iteration we use the formula : \(4\pi \cdot R^{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{i} 24\pi \cdot 5^{n-1} \cdot \frac{R^{2}}{2^{2n}}\). Unlike the volume, the surface area converges to infinity regardless of the radius of the initial sphere.</p>
				<p>&nbsp If we were to complete further research, it would be interesting to find the volume of the octahedron that contains our fractals and define a formula for it to find its convergence. We could also change the shape of our fractal by reversing the ratio of radius a each iteration or add spheres between the 3d axis in addition to our fractal. Because we learned that fractals are really common in nature - even more common than euclidian shapes - it would be interesting if there is some similarities with our fractal and our solar system or other multiplanetary system.	</p>
