<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.14</h1>
<p>
Because the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$ are the representatives of all the classes in $\Z/n\Z$ and we have shown that they are invertible if and only if they are coprime to $n$.
We have the equality in Proposition 4.

<p>
For $n=12$ we list the coprime elements: $\{1,5,7,11\}$. Indeed, all these elements are invertible as is shown below.
\begin{align*}
1\cdot 1 = 1 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{12}\\
5\cdot 5 = 25 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{12}\\
7\cdot 7 = 49 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{12}\\
11\cdot 11 = 1 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{12}\\
\end{align*}
