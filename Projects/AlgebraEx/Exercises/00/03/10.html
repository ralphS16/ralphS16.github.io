<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.10</h1>
<p>
Let $a \in \left(\Z/n\Z\right)^{\times}$, there exists $b \in \Z/n\Z$ such that $ab = 1 + kn$ for some $k \in \Z$ when we think of $a$ and $b$ as representatives of
their classes instead of elements in the ring. Hence, we can write $1 = ab + (-k)n$
showing that $\gcd{(a,n)} = 1$ since it must be the smallest positive integer that can be written as a combination of $a$ and $n$. We have shown that
$\left\lvert\left(\Z/n\Z\right)^{\times}\right\rvert \leq \varphi(n)$ but the reverse inequality was shown in the example on page 11 of the book so we are done.
