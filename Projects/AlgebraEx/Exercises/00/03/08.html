<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.8</h1>
<p>
Let $a,b,c$ be positive integers (no loss of generality since $a^2 = (-a)^2$) that satisfy the equation and suppose that $a$ is the smallest integer that can satisfy it.
As suggested, we consider the equation mod 4. The left hand side is never congruent to 3 and the right hand side is congruent to either 0 or 3 because square numbers
are either in $\bar{0}$ or $\bar{1}$. We infer that $c^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$, namely, $c^2$ is divisible by 4, we also see that $a^2+b^2$ is
divisible by 4 but more importantly, from 0.3.7, we infer that $a^2$ and $b^2$ are each divisible by 4. Therefore, we can factor 4 in our equation giving
$$4x^2 + 4y^2 = 12z^2$$ where $x^2 = a^2/4$, $y^2=b^2/4$ and $z^2 = c^2/4$. Now, by dividing 4 we see that $x,y,z$ also satisfy the equation.
Hence, we found a smaller integer than $a$ satisfying the equation and this contradicts our assumption.
