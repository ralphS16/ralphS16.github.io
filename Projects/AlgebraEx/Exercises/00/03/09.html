<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.9</h1>
<p>
Let $k \in \Z$ and write the following
$$(2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2+k) + 1$$
This is congruent to 1 modulo 8 if and only if $k^2+k \equiv 0,2,4,6 \pmod{8}$ because we need $4(k^2+k) \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$. This is also equivalent to $k^2+k \equiv 0,2 \pmod{4}$.
We can check that $0^2 + 0$, $1^2+1$, $2^2 + 2$ and $3^2 + 3$ are all congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 4 so for any $k$, $(2k+1)^2$ is congruent to 1 in $\Z/8\Z$. This also means
that all the elements in $\Z/8\Z$ are their own multiplicative inverse.
