<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.12</h1>
<p>
Denote $\gcd{(a,n)} = d \neq 1$, by the definition of the greatest common divisor, we must have $1 < d$ and we can write $a = da'$ and $n = dn'$ for some $a', n' \in \Z$.
Note that we have $1 \leq n' < n$ so we can write $an' = da'n' = dn'a' = na' \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ and we see that $b = n'$ is the integer we are looking for.

<p>
Now, suppose there exists an integer $c$ such that $ac \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, this implies $abc \equiv b \pmod{n}$ which is a contradiction because $b \not\equiv 0 \pmod{n}$.
