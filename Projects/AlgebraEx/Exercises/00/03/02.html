<h1>Preliminaries: #0.3.2</h1>
<p>
Let $a \in \Z$ be any integer, by the division algorithm, we have $a = qn+r$ where $0\leq r < n$. This implies that $n$ divides $a-r = qn$, in other words
$a \equiv r \pmod{n}$ or $\bar{a} = \bar{r}$. This means that any integer is in an equivalence class with a representative in $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$.
