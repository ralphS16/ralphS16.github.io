<h1>Preliminaries: #0.2.7</h1>
<p>
Let $a,b$ be any non-zero integer, let $i,j$ be the maximal positive integers such that $p^i$ divides $a$ and $p^j$ divides $b$ (both can be 0).
Then, we can write the following:
\begin{align*}
  a = p^ic &amp;\implies a^2=p^{2i}c^2 \quad \mbox{ where } \gcd{(p,c)} = \gcd{(p,c^2)} = 1\\
  b = p^jd &amp;\implies b^2=p^{2j}d^2 \quad \mbox{ where } \gcd{(p,d)} = \gcd{(p,d^2)} = 1\\
\end{align*}
Suppose that $a^2 = pb^2$, we get $p^{2i}c^2 = p^{2j+1}d^2$ and since $c^2$ and $d^2$ are not divisible by $p$, we must have $2i = 2j+1$ which is absurd since $i$ and $j$ are integers.
