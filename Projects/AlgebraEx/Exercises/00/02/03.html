<h1>Preliminaries: #0.2.3</h1>
<p>
We will assume that $n$ is positive, we would get the same argument by multiplying by -1 for negative numbers.
Since $n$ is composite, it has one positive divisor which is not 1 nor itself.
Call this divisor $a$, clearly, $a < n$ since $ak > a$ for any $k \geq 1$.
Moreover, there must exist an integer $b$ such that $ab = n$, and by the same argument as before $b < n$.
We have $n= (1)(ab)$ so $n$ divides $ab$ but since $a,b < n$ we cannot have $n \mid a$ nor $n \mid b$.
