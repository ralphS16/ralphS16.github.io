<h1>Preliminaries: #0.2.2</h1>
<p>
  Because $k$ divides both $a$ and $b$, there exists 2 integers $c$ and $d$ such that $a = ck$ and $b=dk$. Thus, for any pair of integers $s$ and $t$, we can write the following.
  $$as + bt = cks + dkt = k(cs + dt)$$
  Hence, there exists an integer $e = cs+dt$ such that $ek = as+bt$, namely, $k$ divides $as+bt$.
