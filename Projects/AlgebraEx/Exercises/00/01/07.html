<h1>Preliminaries: #0.1.7</h1>
<p>
  We show that the 3 properties of an equivalence class are satisfied. For any $a,b,c \in A$,
</p>
<ol>
    <li>$\sim$ is reflexive since $f(a) = f(a)$</li>
    <li>$\sim$ is symmetric since $f(a) = f(b) = f(a)$</li>
    <li>$\sim$ is trasitive since $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f(a) = f(c)$ implies that $f(b) = f(c)$</li>
  </ol>
<p>
  Moreover, let $X$ be an equivalence class such that for all $a \in X$, we have $f(a) = x$. Now, consider $f^{-1}(x) = \{a \in A \mid f(a) = x\}$. We clearly see that $a \in f^{-1}(x)$ if and only if $a \in X$.
