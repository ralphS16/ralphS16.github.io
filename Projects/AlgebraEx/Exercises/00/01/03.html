<h1>Preliminaries: #0.1.3</h1>
<p>
We know that $P$ and $Q$ are in $\mathcal{B}$, namely, $MP = PM$ and $MQ = QM$. Now, we determine $M(PQ)$ and $(PQ)M$.
$$M(PQ) = (MP)Q = (PM)Q = P(MQ)= P(QM) = (PQ)M$$
Indeed, we have that $PQ \in \mathcal{B}$. Note that we used the fact that matrix multiplication is associative.
