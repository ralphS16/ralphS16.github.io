<h1>Preliminaries: #0.1.2</h1>
<p>
We know that $P$ and $Q$ are in $\mathcal{B}$, namely, $MP = PM$ and $MQ = QM$. Now, we determine $M(P+Q)$ and $(P+Q)M$.
$$M(P+Q) = MP+MQ = PM + QM = (P+Q)M$$
Indeed, we have that $P+Q \in \mathcal{B}$. Note that we used the fact that matrix multiplication is distributive over matrix addition.
