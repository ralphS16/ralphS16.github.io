<li>The subset is not empty because it contains $1^n$. Moreover, if it contains $x^n$ and $y^n$, then 
it also contains $x^n(y^n)^{-1} = (xy^{-1})^n$, so it is a subgroup.

<li>This subset is not empty because it contains $1$. Moreover, if it contains $x$ and $y$, then it also contains $xy^{-1}$ because
$$(xy^{-1})^n = x^{n}(y^n)^{-1} = 1.$$
