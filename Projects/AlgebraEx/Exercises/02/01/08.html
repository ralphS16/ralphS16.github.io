<h1>Chapter 2: #2.1.8</h1>
<p>If $H\subseteq K$, then $H \cup K = K$ and it is clearly a subgroup. Similarly for the symmetric case. If there are elements 
$x \in H\setminus K$ and $y \in K \setminus H$, then $xy$ cannot be in $H \cup K$. If that were the case, then $xy$ would be
either in $H$ or $K$. The former implies $x^{-1}xy = y \in H$ and the latter $xyy^{-1} = x \in K$, and both are contradictions.
