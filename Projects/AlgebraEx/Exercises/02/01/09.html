<h1>Chapter 2: #2.1.9</h1>
<p>This follows easily from the multiplicativity of the determinant. Indeed, for any $X,Y \in \text{SL}_n(F)$, we have 
$$\det(Y)\det(Y^{-1}) = \det(YY^{-1}) = \det(\text{id}) = 1,$$
so $\det(Y^{-1}) = \det(Y)^{-1} = 1$. Therefore, we conclude $$\det(XY^{-1}) = \det(X)\det(Y^{-1}) = 1\implies XY^{-1} \in \text{SL}_n(F).$$
Since $\text{id}$ always has determinant one, $\text{SL}_n(F)$ is non-empty and is a subgroup of $\text{GL}_n(F)$.
