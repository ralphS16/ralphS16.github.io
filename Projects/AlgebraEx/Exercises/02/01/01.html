<li>Denote the subset by $H$, it is clear that $H$ is non-empty since $0 = 0+0i = \in H$. Now, if $a+ai, b+bi \in H$, then 
$a+ai + -(b+bi) = (a-b) + (a-b)i \in H$. By the subgroup criterion, $H$ is a subgroup of $\C$.
</li>
<li>Denote the subset by $H$, it is cleart that $H$ is non-empty since $|1| = 1$, so $1 \in H$. Recall the the absolute value 
satisfies $|xy| = |x||y|$ for any $x, y \in \C$. Thus, if $x,y \in H$, then $xy^{-1} \in H$ because 
$$|xy^{-1}| = |x||y^{-1}| = 1|y^{-1}| = |y||y^{-1}| = |yy^{-1}| = |1| = 1.$$
By the subgroup criterion, $H$ is a subgroup of $\C$.
</li>
<li>Denote the subset by $H_n$, it is clear that $H$ is non-empty since $\frac{1}{n} \in H$. Let $x,y \in H$, we can write 
$x = \frac{a}{b}$ and $y = \frac{c}{d}$ with $b,d \mid n$, the last part can be rewritten with $bk_1= dk_2 = n$ for $k_1, k_2 \in \Z$. 
We obtain $$x+(-y) = \frac{a}{b}-\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ak_1}{n} - \frac{ck_2}{n} = \frac{ak_1-ck_2}{n},$$
so $x-y \in H$. By the subgroup criterion, $H$ is a subgroup of $\Q$.
</li>
<li>Denote the subset by $H$, it is clear that $H$ is non-empty since $\frac{1}{1} \in H$. Let $x,y \in H$, we can write 
$x = \frac{a}{b}$ and $y = \frac{c}{d}$ with $\gcd(b,n) = \gcd(d,n) = 1$. We obtain 
$$x+(-y) = \frac{a}{b}-\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad-bc}{bd},$$
and since $\gcd(b,d) = 1$, $x-y \in H$. By the subgroup criterion, $H$ is a subgroup of $\Q$.
</li>
<li>Denote the subset by $H$, it is clear that $H$ is non-empty since $1 \in H$. Let $x,y \in H$, we have 
$\left(x\cdot \frac{1}{y}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{y^2} \in \Q$ because it is the division of two rational numbers. Therefore, 
$x\cdot \frac{1}{y} \in H$, and by the subgroup criterion, $H$ is a subgroup of $\R$.
