<h1>Chapter 2: #2.1.17</h1>
<p>The same argument as in 2.1.16 shows that the product $UV^{-1}$ for $U$ and $V$ in this subset is also upper triangular. 
To see that it has a diagonal of ones, it is enough to show that $V^{-1}$ by has a diagonal of ones, this is true because $V$ has 
a diagonal of ones.
