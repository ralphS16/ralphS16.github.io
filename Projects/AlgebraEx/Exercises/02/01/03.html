<li>Note that all the elements commute and each element is its own inverse. Therefore, we only need to check if any 
product of two or three distinct elements stays in the subset. For two elements, it is easy to check: $r^2\cdot s = sr^2$, 
$r^2 \cdot sr^2 = s$ and $s\cdot sr^2 = r^2$. For three element, we only have one combination, namely $r^2\cdot s\cdot sr^2 = 1$.
We can conclude that this is a subgroup of $D_8$.

<li>We are in the same case as above where all elements commute and each element is its own inverse. We can check that 
$r^2\cdot sr = sr^3$, $r^2 \cdot sr^3 = sr$ and $sr\cdot sr^3 = r^2$ as well as $r^2\cdot sr \cdot sr^3 = 1$ to conclude that 
this subset is a subgroup.
