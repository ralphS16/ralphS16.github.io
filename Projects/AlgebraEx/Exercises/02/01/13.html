<h1>Chapter 2: #2.1.13</h1>
<p>It is enough to show that this subgroup contains $\Z$ because then it contains also contains all the reciprocals of integers 
and for any $p,q \in \Z$, we have $$\frac{1}{q} + \stackrel{p \text{times}}{\cdots} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{p}{q} \in \Q.$$

Additionally, since $\Z$ is generated by $1$, it is enough to show $1$ is in the subgroup. To see this, let $\frac{p}{q}$ be 
a nonzero element of this subgroup written in reduced form (i.e.: $\text{gcd}(p,q) = 1$). Then, adding this element $q$ times shows
$p$ is in the subgroup and adding its reciprocal $p$ times shows $q$ is in the subgroup. By the properties of the gcd, there 
exists $u,v \in \Z$ such that $up + vq = 1$, so $1$ belongs to the subgroup.
