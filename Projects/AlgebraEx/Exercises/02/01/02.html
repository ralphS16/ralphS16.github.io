<li>This set does not contain the identity in $S_n$ so it cannot be a subgroup.
</li>
<li>This set does not contain the identity in $D_{2n}$ so it cannot be a subgroup.
</li>
<li>Write $n = p_1\cdots p_n$ where $p_i$ are not necessarily distinct primes. Let $x \in G$ be of order $n$, we have 
$|x^{p_1}| = p_2\cdots p_n \neq 1, n$, so $x^{p_1}$ is not in the subset. We conclude that the subset cannot be a subgroup.
</li>
<li>We see from $1+3 = 4$ that the subset is not closed under addition, so it cannot be a subgroup.
</li>
<li>We see from $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$ that the subset is not closed 
under addition, so it cannot be a subgroup.
</li>
