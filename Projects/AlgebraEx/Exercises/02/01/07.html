<h1>Chapter 2: #2.1.7</h1>
<p>If $(a,b)$ is in the torsion subgroup, then there is some nonzero $m \in \N$ such that $m(a,b) = (ma,mb) = (0,0)$. Looking at 
the first coordinate, we can infer that $a= 0$, so $0 \times \Z/n\Z$ contains the torsion subgroup. We claim that 
it is equal to it because $n(0,b) = (0,nb) = (0,0)$ for any $b \in \Z/n\Z$.

<p>
Both $(1,1)$ and $(-1,0)$ have infinite order but $(1,1) + (-1,0) = (0,1)$ has finite order, hence the subset of elements with 
infinite order and the identity does not form a subgroup.
