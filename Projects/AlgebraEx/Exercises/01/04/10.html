$$ \begin{bmatrix}a_1&amp; b_1\\0&amp; c_1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a_2&amp; b_2\\0&amp; c_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1a_2&amp; a_1b_2+b_1c_2\\0&amp; c_1c_2 \end{bmatrix}$$
Since all of $a_1, a_2, c_1, c_2$ are non-zero, the diagonal entries of the product are non-zero, hence the group is closed under 
multiplication.
</li>
<li>
We use the simple formula to find inverses of $2\times 2$ matrices:
$$ \begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b\\0&amp; c\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{c}{ac} &amp; \frac{-b}{ac}\\0&amp; \frac{a}{ac}\end{bmatrix}$$
Since $a,c \neq 0$, all entries are well defined and the diagonal entries are non-zero, so we get that the group is closed under inverses.
</li>
<li>
It is clear that the identity is in $G$, so $G$ is a subgroup of $\text{GL}_2(\R)$.
</li>
<li>
Go back to the computations in a. and b. and replace $c$ by $a$ and $c_i$ by $a_i$. We see that for the multiplication 
and the inverse, the diagonal entries stay equal. The indentity is also in this new set, so it is a subgroup of $\text{GL}_2(\R)$.
