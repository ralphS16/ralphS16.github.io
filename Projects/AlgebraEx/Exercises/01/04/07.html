<h1>Chapter 1: #1.4.7</h1>
<p>We will make a combinatorial arugment. We first pick entries for the first row, there are $p^2-1$ ways to do that 
because each entry has $p$ choices but we cannot pick two zeros or the matrix would not be invertible. For the second row, 
we have $p^2$ choices but $p$ of them are multiples of the first row (multiplying by each element of the field. In total, 
we get $(p^2-1)(p^2-p) = p^4-p^3-p^2+p$ invertible matrices.
