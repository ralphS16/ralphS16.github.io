<h1>Chapter 1: #1.4.1</h1>
<p>Recall that $\text{GL}_2(\F_2)$ is the set of matrices with entries in $\F_2$ and with non-zero determinant.
If we write such a matrix as $\begin{bmatrix}a&amp; b\\c&amp; d\end{bmatrix}$, we can see that the condition on the 
determinant is equivalent to $a \wedge c = b \wedge d$ because the product in $\F_2$ can be seen as an AND of two bits.
We consider two cases, if the L.H.S is 1, then $a = c= 1$ and we have three possibilities for $b$ and $d$ (they cannot be 
both 1). If the L.H.S is 0, then $b = d = 1$ and we have three possibilities for $a$ and $c$, we get a total of six poissibiliites.
