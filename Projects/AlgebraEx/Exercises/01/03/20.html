<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.20</h1>
<p>We write $S_3 = \langle (1\ 2), (1\ 2\ 3) \mid (1\ 2)^2 = (1\ 2\ 3)^3 = 1, (1\ 2\ 3)(1\ 2) = (1\ 2)(1\ 2\ 3)^{-1}\rangle$. 
Note that if we put $r = (1\ 2\ 3)$ and $s = (1\ 2)$, this is the same presentation as $D_6$, this is because $S_3$ is isomorphic to 
$D_6$ (a notion that is covered later in the book).
