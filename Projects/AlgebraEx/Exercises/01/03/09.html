<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.9</h1>
<p>We make a more general argument. Let $\pi$ be a $k$-cycle, first note that it has order $k$ (1.3.10 proves this).
We can use this to reduce our argument to positive integers between one and $k$ since for all $n \in \Z$ and $1 \leq i < k$,
we have $\pi^{nk + i} = \pi^i$. Then, we can use the argument in 1.3.11.

We just write the elements with gcd equal to one.
