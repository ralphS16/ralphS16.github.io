This cycle is easy to construct. First note that $\tau$ has order two, so if we want $\sigma$ to be a 10-cycle (it is easier 
to start with this assumption), we will have $k = 5$. Then, we just have to place the elements of the transpositions in our cycle
such thtat a jump of 5 elements separates them:
$$ \sigma = (1\ 3\ 5\ 7\ 9\ 2\ 4\ 6\ 8\ 10)$$
</li>
<li>
Suppose $\sigma$ exists, then write it as $(a_1\ a_2\ \cdots\ a_m)$. Without loss of generality, $a_1 = 1$, and because
$\sigma^k(1) = 2$ and $\sigma^k(2) = 1$, we must have $a_{1+k} = 2$ and $a_{1+2k} =1 = a_1$. This means $n = 2k$. We can do 
the same argument with $a_1 = 3$ to see that $n = 3k$.
