<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.15</h1>
<p>Let $\sigma = \sigma_1\cdots\sigma_k$ be the disjoint cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ and $m = \text{lcm}(|\sigma_1|, \dots, |\sigma_k|)$.
Suppose $|\sigma| = n$, then $\sigma^n = \sigma_1^n\cdots\sigma_k^n = 1$. Since the cycles are all disjoint, we cannot have 
$\sigma_1^n\cdots \widehat{\sigma_i^n}\cdots \sigma_k^n = \sigma_i^{-n}$ unless $\sigma_i^n = 1$, impying it is true for all $i$ (the hat means the element is omitted in the product).
We infer that for all $i$, $|\sigma_i| \mid n$ and that means $m \mid n$. Moreover, it is clear that $\sigma^m = 1$, hence $n\leq m$ 
and we get $m = n$.
