<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.10</h1>
<p>The result is clear for $i=1$, because this is the definition of a cycle. If it holds for some $i$, then it must hold for $i+1$
because $\sigma^{i+1}(a_k) = \sigma(\sigma^i(a_k)) = \sigma(a_{k+i}) = a_{k+i+1}$ (by the principle of mathematical induction, we are done).
We conclude that the order of $\sigma$ is $m$ because if $i< m$, we have $\sigma^i(a_1) = a_{1+i \text{ mod } m} \neq a_1$ and $\sigma^i(a_j) = a_{j+m \text{ mod } m} = a_j$ for all $j$.
