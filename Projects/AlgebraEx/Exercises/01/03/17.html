<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.17</h1>
<p>The product of two disjoint transpositions can be represented as $(a_1\ a_2)(a_3\ a_4)$, with the 
$a_i$'s being distinct elements from $\{1,\dots, n\}$. Thus, we are choosing two elements without order 
and then two new elements with two fewer choices and again without order. Finally, since the transpositions 
commute, their order is no important so we can divide by two, yielding 
$$\binom{n}{2}\cdot \binom{n-2}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}\cdot\frac{(n-2)!}{2!(n-4)!}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{8}$$
distinct products of two disjoint transpositions in $S_n$.
