<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.16</h1>
<p>An $m$-cycle is represented by $m$ integers from $\{1,\dots, n\}$ with a specific order, and 
there are $n(n-1)\cdots (n-m+1)$ such representations. However, each distinct $m$-cycle has $m$ different 
representations since you can start with any of the $m$ elements of the cycle, therefore, we have exactly
$$\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-m+1)}{m}$$ distinct $m$-cycles in $S_n$.
