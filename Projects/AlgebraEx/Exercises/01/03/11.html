<h1>Chapter 1: #1.3.11</h1>
<p>($\Rightarrow$) We prove the contrapositive. Suppose $\gcd(i,m) = d > 1$, then we have $(\sigma^i)^{m/d} = (\sigma^m)^{i/d} = 1$.
Hence, the order of $\sigma$ is less or equal than $m/d < m$, implying $\sigma$ is not an $m$-cycle.

<p>
($\Leftarrow$) It is enough to show that $\{(\sigma^i)^j(1) \mid 1\leq j \leq m\} = \{1, \dots, m\}$ because that would mean
1 is in an $m$-cycle of $\sigma^i$ and it must be the only one because $\sigma$ only moves $m$ elements. To prove our claim, 
we use the formula from 1.3.10:
$$ \{(\sigma^i)^j(1) \mid 1\leq j \leq m\} = \{(1+ij) \text{ mod } m \mid 1 \leq j \leq m\} = \{1, \dots, m\}$$
There are multiple ways to argue for the last step. For example, one could use the fact that integers that are relatively 
prime with $m$ generate the group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$.
