<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.2</h1>
<p>Let $|x| = n$, it is clear that $|\varphi(x)|\leq n$ because $1 = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ by 1.6.1. Suppose that 
$|\varphi(x)| = m < n$, then we get $1 = \varphi(x)^m = \varphi(x^m)$. Since $\varphi$ is injective, this implies 
$x^m = 1$ and contradicts the fact that $m< n$.

It does not hold for every homomorphism. One simple counterexample is mapping the trivial group inside any other group.
