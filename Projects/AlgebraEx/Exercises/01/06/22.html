<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.22</h1>
<p> We show it is an isomorphism: $$f(xy) = (xy)^k = x^ky^k = f(x)f(y).$$
Now, if $k = -1$, then the kernel is trivial because $g^{-1} = 1 \Leftrightarrow g = 1$. Also, the map is surjective 
because for all $g \in G$, $(g^{-1})^{-1} = g$, so every element has a pre-image. We conclude that the map is an automorphism.
