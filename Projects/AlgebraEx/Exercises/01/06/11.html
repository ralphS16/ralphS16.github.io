<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.11</h1>
<p>We claim the map $f: A\times B \rightarrow B\times A$ defined by $(a, b) \mapsto (b,a)$ is an isomorphism. It is trivial 
to show that $(b,a) \mapsto (a,b)$ is a two-sided inverse, so $f$ is indeed a bijection. Also, we have 
$$f((a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)) = f((a_1a_2,b_1b_2)) = (b_1b_2,a_1a_2) = (b_1,a_1)(b_2,a_2) = f((a_1,b_1))f((a_2,b_2)),$$
hence $f$ is a homomorphism.
