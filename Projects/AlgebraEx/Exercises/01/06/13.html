<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.13</h1>
<p> If $x,y \in \varphi(G)$, then there exists $a,b \in G$, such that $\varphi(a) = x$ and $\varphi(b) = y$. Therefore, we can 
write $$x^{-1} = \varphi(a)^{-1} = \varphi(a^{-1}) \in \varphi(G)$$ and $$xy = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(ab) \in \varphi(G),$$
so by 1.1.26, $\varphi(G)$ is a subgroup of $H$.
</p>
<p> If $\varphi$ is injective, then since it is also surjective in $\varphi(G)$ (by definition), it is bijective from $G$ to $\varphi(G)$.
This implies $G \cong \varphi(G)$.
