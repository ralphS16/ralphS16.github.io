<li>We use induction. For $n = 0$, it is obvious because $\varphi(x^0) = \varphi(1) = 1 = \varphi(x)^0$. Suppose it holds for some 
$n$, then $$\varphi(x^{n+1}) = \varphi(x^n\cdot x) = \varphi(x^n)\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^n\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^{n+1},$$
so the result follows by induction.
</li>
<li>
We have the following:
$$ 1 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(x\cdot x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)\varphi(x^{-1})$$
By uniqueness of the inverse, we must have $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$. Now, for all $n \in \Z^{-1}$, using part a., 
we have $\varphi(x^{-n}) = \varphi(x)^{-n}$, so we also have $\varphi((x^{-n})^{-1}) = \left(\varphi(x)^{-n}\right)^{-1}$ which 
implies $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ and we are done.
