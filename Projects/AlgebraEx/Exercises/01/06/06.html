<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.6</h1>
<p>Suppose $\varphi: \Q \rightarrow \Z$ is a group isomorphism and let $x = \varphi^{-1}(1)$. We can write the following:
$$\varphi(\frac{x}{2}) = \varphi(x-\frac{x}{2}) = \varphi(x) -\varphi(\frac{x}{2}) = 1- \varphi(\frac{x}{2}).$$
Denoting $y = \varphi(\frac{x}{2})$, we get the equation $1-y = y$ which has no solutions in $\Z$, so we get a contradiction.
