<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.26</h1>
<p>As for the last question, we just need to verify all relations from 1.5.3 hold. Namely, we need to show 
$|\varphi(i)| = |\varphi(j)| = 4$, $\varphi(i)\varphi(j)\varphi(i) = \varphi(j)$ and $\varphi(j)\varphi(i)\varphi(j) = \varphi(i)$. 
These verifications only need a few matrix computations which we omit.
