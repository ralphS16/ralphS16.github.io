<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.23</h1>
<p> We claim that the map $x \mapsto x^{-1}\sigma(x)$ is injective. Indeed, let $x,y \in G$ be such that $x^{-1}\sigma(x) = y^{-1}\sigma(y)$, 
by rearranging, we get $yx^{-1} = \sigma(y)\sigma(x^{-1}) = \sigma(yx^{-1})$. Our hypothesis implies that 
$yx^{-1} = 1$, so $y = x$ by uniqueness of the inverse. Since the maps goes from $G$ to $G$ and it is injective, it must be 
surjective and then any element can be written as $x^{-1}\sigma(x)$. Denote $y = x^{-1}\sigma(x)$, then $\sigma(y) = \sigma(x)^{-1}x = y^{-1}$.
We get that $\sigma$ is the map $g \mapsto g^{-1}$. Now, we use 1.6.17 to conclude that $G$ is abelian.
