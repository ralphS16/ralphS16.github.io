<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.20</h1>
<p> The identity map $\mathbb{1}$ is an automorphism and it is clear that $\mathbb{1} \circ \varphi = \varphi \circ \mathbb{1} = \varphi$ for any $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(G)$.
Also, for any $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, $\varphi^{-1}$ is also bijective and it is a homomorphism since $\varphi$ is injective and for all $a,b \in G$, we have 
$$\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(a)\varphi^{-1}(b)) = \varphi(\varphi^{-1}(a))\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(b)) = ab = \varphi(\varphi^{-1}(ab)).$$
Finally, if $\varphi, \psi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, $\varphi \circ \psi$ is also bijective and 
$$(\varphi \circ \psi)(ab) = \varphi(\psi(ab)) = \varphi(\psi(a)\psi(b)) = \varphi(\psi(a))\varphi(\psi(b)) = (\varphi \circ \psi)(a)(\varphi \circ \psi)(b).$$
Since function composition is already associative, all the conditions are satisfied for $\text{Aut}(G)$ to be a group.
