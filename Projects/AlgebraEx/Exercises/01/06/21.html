<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.21</h1>
<p> The homomorphism property follows from the distributivity of multiplication over addition (i.e.: $k(q_1+q_2) = kq_1+kq_2$). 
The map is injective because $kq = 0 \Leftrightarrow q = 0$, so the kernel is trivial. It is surjective because for any 
$q \in \Q$, $k(k^{-1}q) = q$, so every element has a pre-image.
