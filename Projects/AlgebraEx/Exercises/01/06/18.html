<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.18</h1>
<p>($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $f:g \mapsto g^{2}$ is a homomorphism and let $x,y \in G$, then we have 
$$ xyxy = (xy)^2 = f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = x^2y^2.$$
If we multiply by $x^{-1}$ on the left and $y^{-1}$ on the right, we get $xy = yx$, so $G$ is abelian.
</p>
<p> ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $G$ is abelian, then we have 
$$ f(xy) = (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = f(x)f(y),$$
so $f$ is a homomorphism.
