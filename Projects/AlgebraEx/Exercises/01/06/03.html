<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.3</h1>
<p>($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $G$ is commutative and let $x, y \in H$, then since $\varphi$ is surjective, there exists $a,b \in G$ such that $\varphi(a) = x$ and $\varphi(b) = y$. 
Thus, we can write 
$$ xy = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(ab) = \varphi(ba) = \varphi(b)\varphi(a) = yx$$
and conclude that $H$ is commutative.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $H$ is commutative and let $x, y \in G$, then there exists $a,b \in H$ such that $\varphi^{-1}(a) = x$ and $\varphi^{-1}(b) = y$.
Thus, we can write
$$ xy = \varphi^{-1}(a)\varphi^{-1}(b) = \varphi^{-1}(ab) = \varphi^{-1}(ba) = \varphi^{-1}(b)\varphi^{-1}(a) = yx$$
and conclude that $G$ is commutative.

Note that for the first direction, we only used the fact that $\varphi$ was surjective so it is sufficient for the commutativity of $G$ 
to imply the commutativity of $H$.
