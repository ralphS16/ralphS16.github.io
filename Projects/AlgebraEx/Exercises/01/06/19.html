<h1>Chapter 1: #1.6.19</h1>
<p>Denote the map with $f$ and let $x,y \in G$. We first show it is a homomorphism: $$f(xy) = (xy)^k = x^ky^k = f(x)f(y).$$
Next, for all $x \in G$, there exists $n \in \Z^+$ such that $x^n = 1$, thus $\sqrt[k]{x}^nk = 1$ and $\sqrt[k]{x} \in G$. Since 
$\sqrt[k]{x}^k = x$, every element in $G$ has a preimage in $G$, so $f$ is surjective. Finally, if $f$ were surjective, the 
polynomial $x^k-1$ would have only one root in $\C$, but this is impossible for $k > 1$ by the fundamental theorem of algebra.
