<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.7</h1>
<p>If $\forall (r_1, \dots, r_n) \in \R^n$, we have $\alpha(r_1, \dots, r_n) = (r_1, \dots, r_n)$, then in particular, $\forall r_1 \in \R$, 
$\alpha r_1 = r_1$. By uniqueness of the identity, we get $\alpha = 1$. Thus, the kernel consists only of the identity and the action 
is faithful.
