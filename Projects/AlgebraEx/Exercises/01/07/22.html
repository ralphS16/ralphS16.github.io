<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.22</h1>
<p>Denote the group of rigid motions of the cube as $G$ and notice that this group acts on the set of four pairs of opposite 
faces of the octahedron. Moreover, this action is faithful because if a non-trivial motion acts like the identity, then it 
only flips opposite faces without moving them and it flips at least one. This cannot be done with a rigid motion, so the 
kernel of the action is trivial. By numbering the pairs from 1 to 4, we get an injective homomorphism to $S_4$ and by 1.2.11, $|G| = 24 = |S_4|$, 
so the two groups are isomorphic and it is also isomorphic to the gorup of rigid motions of the cube.
