<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.19</h1>
<p>This map is a surjection by definition of $\mathcal{O}$. It is injective because if $h_1x = h_2x$, then 
$h_2^{-1}h_1x = 1$ and by uniqueness of the identity and inverse, we get $h_1 = h_2$. Therefore, this map is a bijection. 
To conclude Lagrange's theorem, recall from 1.7.18 that the orbits of the action form a partition of $G$. Hence, if there are 
$k$ orbits (all of size $|H|$), we get $|G| = k|H|$ implying $|H|$ divide $|G|$. Since $H$ was an arbitrary subgroup, the result 
holds for all subgroups.
