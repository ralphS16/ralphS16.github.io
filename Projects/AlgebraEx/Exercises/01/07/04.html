<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.4</h1>
<p><ol type="a">
<li>The kernel of the action is equal to the kernel of the permutation representation (a formal proof is given in 1.7.5). Since the 
kernel of a group homomorphism is a subgroup (1.6.14), the kernel of th action is also a subgroup.
</li>
<li>
Denote the stabilizer of $a$ as $\text{Stab}(a)$ and let $g,h \in \text{Stab}(a)$. We have $a = (g^{-1}g)a = g^{-1}(ga) = g^{-1}a$, so 
$g^{-1} \in \text{Stab}(a)$. Also, we have $(gh)a = g(h(a)) = g(a) = a$, so $gh \in \text{Stab}(a)$. By 1.1.26, the stabilizer of $a$ 
is a subgroup.
