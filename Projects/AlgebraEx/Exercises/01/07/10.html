<li> It is clear that for $k = 0$ and $k = |A|$, the action is not faithful because every permutation acts like the identity
on the set of one subset of size $k$. Let $k$ be strictly between 0 and $|A|$ and $\sigma \in S_n$ be in the 
kernel of the action. For all $a_1, \dots, a_k \in A$, we have $\sigma\{a_1, \dots, a_k\} = \{a_1, \dots, a_k\}$, so for all $i$, 
$\sigma(a_i) \in \{a_1, \dots, a_k\}$. Suppose towards a contradiction that $\sigma(a_i) = a_j$ with $i\neq j$, then for any $a \in A \setminus \{a_1, \dots, a_k\}$, 
$a_j \in \sigma\{a_1, \dots, \widehat{a_j}, \dots, a_k, a\}$, so $\sigma$ is not in the kernel of the action and we have a contradiction. 
We conclude that we must have $\sigma(a_i) = a_i$ for all $a_i \in A$ and so $\sigma = \text{id}$. Therefore, the kernel of the action is 
trivial and the action is faithful.

<li> It is clear that for $k = 0$, the action is not faithful because every permutation acts like the identity
on the set of one subset of size $k$. Let $k > 0$ and $\sigma \in S_n$ be in the kernel of the action. For all $a_1, \dots, a_k \in A$, we have 
$\sigma(a_1, \dots, a_k) = (a_1, \dots, a_k)$. In particular, for all $a_1 \in A$, $\sigma(a_1) = a_1$, so $\sigma = \text{id}$. 
This means the kernel of the action is trivial and the action is faithful.
