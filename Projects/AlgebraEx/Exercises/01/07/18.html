<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.18</h1>
<p>The relation is reflexive:
$$a = 1\cdot a \implies a\sim a.$$
It is symmetric:
$$a\sim b \implies \exists h \in H, a = hb \implies b = (h^{-1}h)b = h^{-1}(hb) = h^{-1}a \implies b\sim a.$$
It is transitivie:
$$a \sim b\wedge b\sim c\implies \exists h_1, h_2 \in H, a = h_1b \wedge b = h_2c \implies a = h_1h_2c \implies a \sim c.$$
We conclude that this is an equivalence relation.
