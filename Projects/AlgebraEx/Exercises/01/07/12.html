<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.12</h1>
<p>We already know that $D_{2n}$ acts on the vertices of the regular $n$-gon. If we notice that for any $\sigma \in D_{2n}$ and 
opposite vertices $x$ and $y$, $\sigma(x)$ and $\sigma(y)$ are opposites (since it holds for rotation by $\theta$ and relexion by the line crossing 1), 
then we can conclude that $D_{2n}$ also acts on pairs of opposite points. The kernel of this action consists of the identity and 
the rotation by $\pi$ because they are the only transformation that send all vertices to either themselves or their opposite.
