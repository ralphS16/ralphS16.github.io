<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.17</h1>
<p>Denote the map of conjugation by $\varphi$, then $\varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$ as shown in 1.6.16, so $\varphi$ 
is a homomorphism. Suppose that $x \in \ker(\varphi)$, we get the following logical implications:
$$ g(xg^{-1}) = 1 \implies xg^{-1} = g^{-1} \implies x = 1.$$
Therefore, the kernel of $\varphi$ is trivial and it is an isomorphism because the cardinality of the domain and image are the same.
The deductions are trivial: the first one follows from the fact that the order of $\varphi(x)$ must divide the order of $x$ and vice-versa, 
the second one follows from the injectiveness of $\varphi$.
