<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.20</h1>
<p>Denote the group of rigid motions of the tetrahedron as $G$ and notice that this group acts on the four faces of the tetrahedron. 
Moreover, this action is faithful since any non-trivial motion either rotates a face or an edge and both motions move a face. 
If we number the faces from 1 to 4, we get an injective inclusion homomorphism in $S_4$, so $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$.
