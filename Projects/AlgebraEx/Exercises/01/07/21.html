<h1>Chapter 1: #1.7.21</h1>
<p>Denote the group of rigid motions of the cube as $G$ and notice that this group acts on the set of four pairs of opposite 
vertices of the cube (one may view it as an action on the diagonals). Moreover, this action is faithful because if a non-trivial 
motion acts like the identity, then it flips the orientation of one or more diagonals without moving the others and this is not 
possible. By numbering the diagonals from 1 to 4, we get an injective homomorphism to $S_4$ and by 1.2.10, $|G| = 24 = |S_4|$, 
so the two groups are isomorphic.
