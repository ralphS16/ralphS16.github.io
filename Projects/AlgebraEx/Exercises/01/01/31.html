<h1>Chapter 1: #1.1.31</h1>
<p>
  For any element $g \in t(G)$, there is an element $g^{-1} \in t(G)$ so we can pair all the elements in $t(G)$ implying that $|t(G)|$ is even.
Since $|G|$ is even, $|G-t(G)|$ is also even and $G-t(G) - \{1\}$ is non-empty and it contains only elements of order 2.
