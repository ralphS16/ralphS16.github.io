<p>
  Associativity in all of these groups follows from the associativity of the addition in $\Q$.
<ol type="a">
  <li>Yes : Any odd number is a composite of odd numbers, hence, consider $a,b,c,d \in \Z$ where $b$ and $d$ are odd. Write $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}$.
 This may not be in lowest terms but if you can simplify the fraction, you will only remove odd factors of the denominator, so it will stay odd. Inverses will be in the
because you only need to have a minus sign. 0 is the identity.
 </li>
  <li>No : $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$$</li>
  <li>No : $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2} = 1$$</li>
  <li>No : $$1+\frac{-3}{2} = \frac{-1}{2}$$</li>
  <li>Yes : 0 is the identity. Inverses do not change the denominator. The lowest common multiple of 1 and 2 is 2, thus, any addition will result in a denominator
of 1 or 2.
  </li>
  <li>No : $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$$</li>
