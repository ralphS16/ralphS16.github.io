<p>
  Suppose that $x^i = x^j$ with $1\leq i < j < n$, we have $x^j = x^ix^{j-i} = x^jx^{j-i} \implies x^{j-i} = 1$ which contradicts the fact that $|x| = n$. Clearly, if $|x| > |G|$ there is an element in the cyclic group generated by $x$ which is not in $G$, hence contradicting the closure of the binary operation in $G$.
