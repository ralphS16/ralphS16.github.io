<h1>Chapter 1: #1.1.30</h1>
<p> For any $a,b \in A\times B$, we have $(a,1)(1,b) = (a,b) = (1,b)(a,1)$. For any $k \in \Z$, we can now write
  $$(a,b)^k = (a,1)^k(1,b)^k$$
  this is equal to 1 when $(a^k,1) = (a,1)^k = (1,b^k) = (1,b)^k = (1,1)$ which is equivaent to $a^k = b^k = 1$. The smallest $k$ that satisfies this is the least
  common multiple of $|a|$ and $|b|$. By definition, this is the order of $(a,b)$.
