  Denote $n=2k+1$ and suppose there exists an $i \in \{1,\dots, n-1\}$ such that $x^i = x^{-i}$. We can $1 = x^{0} = x^i x^{-i} = x^i x^i = x^{2i}$ which implies $n \mid 2i$. We know that $2i \neq n = 2k+1$ and $2i < 2n$ so this cannot be true and we obtain a contradiction.
</li>
<li>
  From last part, we see that $n \mid 2i$ if and only if $2i = n$ so we must have $k = i$.
