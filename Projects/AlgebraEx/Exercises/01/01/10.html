<h1>Chapter 1: #1.1.10</h1>
<p>
Denote $G = \{g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n\}$, and let $M = (g_ig_j)_{i,j}$ be the group multiplication table. If $G$ is abelian, then $g_i g_j = g_jg_i$ for any $i,j \in \{1,\dots,n\}$
hence, $M_{i,j} = M_{j,i}$ and $M$ is symmetric. If $M$ is symmetric, then $g_ig_j = M_{i,j} = M_{j,i} = g_jg_i$, so $G$ is commutative.
