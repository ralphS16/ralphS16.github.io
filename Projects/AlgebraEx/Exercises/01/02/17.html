  We already saw that $X_{2n}$ had at most six elements. We can easily list them : $\{1,x,x^2,y,yx,yx^2\}$. It is left to show that none of these elements are equal
  and that the generator relations in $D_6$ also hold here. We have seen that $x^3 = 1$ and that $xy = yx^2$ so we obtain $xy = yx^{-1}$ which is the relation in $D_6$
  we did not already have. Now, $1 \neq x$ and $1 \neq y$ by the definition of the notation for group presentation. Then, we also can infer that $x \neq x^2$ because with
  $x^3 = 1$, that would imply that $x = 1$. By the same reasoning, $y \neq 1$ and $x\neq 1$ implies that $yx \neq y$, $yx \neq x$ and $yx^2 \neq x^2$.
  Notice that $(yx)(yx^2) = x \neq x^2 = (yx^2)(yx)$, so $yx \neq yx^2$ because they do not commute. WIth the same argument, $x \neq y$ because $xy \neq yx$.
  Lastly, $1 = x^2$ would imply $x^3 = x$ so it is not true.
  We have shown that all these elements are pairwise different and so $X_{2n} = D_6$.

  We can write $1 = 3u + nv$ and so we get $x^1 = x^{3u+nv} = x^{3u}x^{nv} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$. In this case, $X_{2n}$ only has two elements : $\{1,y\}$.
