<h1>Chapter 1: #1.2.7</h1>

$(\Rightarrow)$ Since $a^2 = s^2 = 1$, we have $ab = ssr = r$. Hence, $(ab)^n = 1$ implies $r^n = 1$. Trivially, we have $s^2 = 1$ and using 1.2.6, we have $rs = sr^{-1}$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Again, we trivially get $a^2 = 1$. In 1.2.3, we showed that $b = sr$ is of order 2, so we get $b^2 = 1$. Since $ab = r$ and $r^n =1$, we also have $(ab)^n = 1$.
