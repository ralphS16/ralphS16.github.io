<h1>Chapter 1: #1.2.3</h1>
<p>
Using the lemma on the previous exercise and the fact that there for any $p$, there exists a negative number $p'$ such that $r^p = r^{p'}$,
we can write any element that is not a power of $r$ in the form $x = sr^p$ with $p \in \Z$.
Then, we can write $$\left(r^ps\right)^2 = r^psr^ps = r^{p-1}rsr^ps = r^{p-1}sr^{-1}r^ps = r^{p-1}sr^{p-1}s $$
This holds for any $p$ and in particular, it holds for $p-1$. Therefore, for a positive $p$,
we can apply this formula multiple times to end up with $rsrs = 1s1s = s^2=1$. For a negative $p$, you can find some positive $p'$ such that $r^p = r^{p'}$.
We have shown that $x$ has order 2.

$D_{2n}$ is clearly generated by $s$ and $sr$ because $ssr = r$ and $s$ and $r$ generate $D_{2n}$.
