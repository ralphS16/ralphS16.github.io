<h1>Chapter 1: #1.2.4</h1>
<p>
It is obvious that $|z| = 2$ because $\left(r^k\right)^2 = r^{2k} = 1$ and $r^k \neq 1$ because $|r| > k$. Clearly, $z$ commutes with all powers of $r$ and from  1.2.2, we see that all elements which are not powers of $r$ don't commute with all powers of $r$ (this is not true if $n=2$ because we have $r = r^{-1}$). Moreover, elements of the form $r^{i}$ will commute with elements of the form $sr^{j}$ if and only if $r^i = r^{-i}$ by 1.2.2. Using 1.1.33, we see that $z$ is the only element satisfying this.
