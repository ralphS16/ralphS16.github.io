<h1>Chapter 1: #1.2.5</h1>
<p>
From 1.2.2, we have seen that an element $z \in D_{2n}$ must be a power of $r$ and satisfy the property $z = z^{-1}$ to commute with all elements. From 1.1.33, we see that this is not possible when $n$ is odd. Since we cannot use 1.2.2 with $n=1$ because $r \notin D_2$, we need to specify $n\geq 3$.
