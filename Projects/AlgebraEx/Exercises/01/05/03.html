<h1>Chapter 1: #1.5.3</h1>
<p>We write $Q_8 = \langle i,j \mid i^4 = j^4= 1, iji = j, jij = i\rangle$. Let us show that all other relations follow from these four. 
First, we show that $i^2 = j^2$, since they are both their own inverse, it is enough to show that $i^2j^2 = 1$. Using $i^2j^2 = i^2(iji)^2 = i^3ji^2ji$, 
we have the following:
$$i(i^2j^2)= i(i^3ji^2ji)= ji^2ji= ji(iji)= jij= i$$
$$j(i^2j^2) = j(jij^2ij^3) = j(jij)jij^3 = jijij^3 = j(iji)j^3 = j^5 = j.$$
With symmetric arguments, we can also show that $i^2j^2$ is a left inverse, hence proving $i^2 = j^2$. Denote this element $-1$. It is clear 
that $-1$ commutes with everything else because it can be written as $i^2$ or $j^2$ and every other element can be written as 
$i^nj^m$ or $j^ni^m$ with $0\leq n,m \leq 3$ (can derive this from the relations). Now, if we write $ij = k$, the relations 
$jk = i$ and $ki = i$ are just the last two relations in our presentations. Lastly, $ij = i(iji)= i^2ji = -ji$. The other relations 
are either trivial or can be derived with the same techniques we used.
